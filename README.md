# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Fight

This silly game was made in collaboration with Michael Werner and Jean Valenzuela-Sanchez for game development class.

This game is a mixture of the famous hand game and a 2D fighter. This silly idea appealed to us, and we decided to move
forward with it. We decided to lean into the silliness of rock paper scissors merged with beating up your friends, so made
the combat match this energy.
