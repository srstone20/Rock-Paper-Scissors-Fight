# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Fight

RPSF is a goofy little game about luck, skill, and out-thinking your enemy. A mixture of the famous hand game and a 2D fighter, play rock paper scissors to win the biggest, strongest weapons to beat eachother up!

Made in collaboration with Michael Werner and Jean Valenzuela-Sanchez for game development class. We decided to lean into the silliness of rock paper scissors merged with beating up your friends, so made the combat physics-based to match this chaotic and wacky concept.
